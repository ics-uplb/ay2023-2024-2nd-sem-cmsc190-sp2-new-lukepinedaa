# Web-based Employee Information System for Hana-net Philippines Co. Inc. Trucking Company
Authors: Luke Adrian D. Pineda and Rizza DC. Mercado

This study addresses the challenges faced by Hana-net Philippines Co. Inc., a trucking company based in Bi√±an, Laguna, transitioning from traditional human resource management methods to a modern, web-based information system. The company, with 78 employees servicing 7 partners, has relied on pen-and-paper records and Excel spreadsheets for HR functions since 1999, which is prone to data insecurity and inefficiencies. This research details the development of a web-based employee information system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to centralize employee data management, streamline payroll processing, automate leave applications, and enhance overall HR operations. System evaluation using Brooke's System Usability Scale (SUS) with ten company employees resulted in a mean score of 76.75, indicating good usability. User feedback highlighted areas for frontend interface improvements while confirming the system's effectiveness in addressing the limitations of manual processes. The successful implementation demonstrates how small businesses in the logistics industry like Hana-net can benefit from tailored information systems.
