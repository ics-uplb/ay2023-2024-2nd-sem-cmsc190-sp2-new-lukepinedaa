\begin{abstract}
    This study addresses the challenges faced by Hana-net Philippines Co. Inc., a trucking company based in Biñan, Laguna, transitioning from traditional human resource management methods to a modern, web-based information system. The company, with 78 employees servicing 7 partners, has relied on pen-and-paper records and Excel spreadsheets for HR functions since 1999, which is prone to data insecurity and inefficiencies. This research details the development of a web-based employee information system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to centralize employee data management, streamline payroll processing, automate leave applications, and enhance overall HR operations. System evaluation using Brooke's System Usability Scale (SUS) with ten company employees resulted in a mean score of 76.75, indicating good usability. User feedback highlighted areas for frontend interface improvements while confirming the system's effectiveness in addressing the limitations of manual processes. The successful implementation demonstrates how small businesses in the logistics industry like Hana-net can benefit from tailored information systems.

% INTRODUCTION
\section{\textbf{INTRODUCTION}}

\subsection{\textbf{Background of the Study}}
Hana-net Philippines Co. Inc. is a trucking company based in Timbao, Biñan City, Laguna. The company, founded on September 24, 1999, has built a strong reputation for its reliable and efficient services. With a team of 78 employees, the company continues to provide its services to a diverse clientele of 7 partners. Over the years, Hana-net has demonstrated a commitment to excellence in the logistics industry, ensuring the satisfaction of its clients.

	Since its inception, the company has used traditional means in data keeping and human resource functions such as payroll management, filing for leave, management of employees’ personal information, etc. such as pen-and-paper and Excel spreadsheets. These methods are certainly functional, however, they come with limitations/and or disadvantages. Firstly, manual entry and management of employee records are prone to risk due to human error. Secondly, the non-existence of a centralized information system such as an online database makes consistency of information difficult. Lastly, the lack of secure and easily accessible data may be prone to tampered and compromised data. 

Recognizing the challenges posed by traditional means, this study aims to develop a web-based information system that will serve as a comprehensive solution to make specific human resource management functions, including but not limited to payroll management, leave applications and management of personnel information. The advantages of an IS directly address the limitations associated with manual processes. Unlike the error-prone manual entry of employee records, an IS ensures data accuracy. Additionally, it provides a centralized platform for managing various HR functions, enhancing transparency, and improving the overall employee experience. Automation features contribute to increased productivity, reducing the likelihood of errors and speeding up HR processes. By implementing this system, improvement of internal processes and overall efficiency are made possible.


\subsection{\textbf{Statement of the Problem}}
The current data-keeping system of the company heavily relies on conventional methods, including pen-and-paper records and Excel spreadsheets. While these methods are functional, they present limitations and/or disadvantages such as the risk of human error, inconsistency, and security.


\subsection{\textbf{Significance of the Study}}
This study aims to help Hana-net Trucking Company organize and systematize their employees' information in a web-based application to address the current disadvantages of traditional data-keeping methods. 


\subsection{\textbf{Objectives of the Study}}
The general objective of this study is to design and implement a web-based application focused on organizing and systemizing employee information and human resources management, specifically made for Hana-net Philippines Co. Inc. Trucking Company.

Specifically, this project intends to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a system for admins to organize, update, and manage employee information through a centralized database;
    \item Implement features for admins to perform HR functions, focusing on attendance tracking and approving leave requests.
    \item Enable employees to update their personal information, review their monthly salary details and file leave applications;
    \item Conduct usability test to assess ease of use, navigation, and overall user experience of the web-application.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{\textbf{Scopes and Limitations of the Study}}
The focus of this study is to provide an application that allows Hana-net to manage their employees’ information. The application is intended to be used by Hana-net management and their employees. The administrator has full access to the web-based application while the employees will have limited access to certain functionalities. 

The application is web-based and will only be accessible using devices with web browsers and access to an internet connection, including smartphones and computers. The application does not support offline services.

% MATERIALS AND METHODS
\section{\textbf{REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE}}
Human Resources (HR) is one of the key aspects of a successful business organization. Managing employees as assets instead of resources (Zeebaree et al., 2019). With the goal of upscaling in mind, the number of employees will increase, making the already difficult task of managing employees even more gruesome. Thus, it is of utmost importance to manage human resources in an efficient and orderly manner (Zeebaree et al., 2019).   


\subsection{\textbf{Information Systems in Human Resources Management}}

Information Systems (IS) have been instrumental in effectively managing business organizations. Since their inception in the 1950s, optimizing business transaction processing functions to today’s cloud-based system, IS has been indispensable in supporting various business functions including Human Resources Management (HRM), which happens to be one of the last business functions to fully implement the use of IS. The implementation of IS in HRM mainly focused on automating payroll and data-intensive tasks like keeping track of employees’ information (Johnson et al., 2016).

In a study entitled “FGEHF: Authenticated Web-Based Application for Human Resource Management System”, Ali et al. (2018) discuss the challenges faced by Human Resources Management (HRM) systems due to their reliance on manual processes in handling employees’ information, salary computation, leave application, etc. Relying on manual processes is not only time-consuming but is also prone to human error. To address the aforementioned challenges of manual processes of HRM, Ali et al. (2018) proposed an authenticated web-based application for a human resource management system. Their proposed system addresses the difficulties faced by their client Federal Government Employee Housing Foundation (FGEHF), which has been operating manually since 1988. The solution seeks to streamline HRM processes, making managing efficient and effective. Additionally, it is expected to result in time and cost savings and error-free and secured data. The system ensures that users and their records are securely stored on database servers which can only be accessed by those with authorization. 


\subsection{\textbf{Information Systems in Small Businesses}
}
In a journal article entitled “An Integrated Model of Information Systems Adoption in Small Businesses”, authored by Thong (1999), an integrated model of Information System (IS) adoption in small businesses was developed and tested based on theories from technological innovation literature. The study used CEO, IS, and organizational characteristics as primary determinants of IS adoption among small businesses. CEOs who are tech-savvy and have knowledge of IS and those with a positive insight into the advantages of IS are most likely to adopt IS. Information intensity and competition are external factors that could affect the adoption of IS by influencing their perceived characteristics, specifically business size and employees’ IS knowledge. The findings of said study found that CEOs play a significant role in the adoption of IS as they control the allocation of resources and weigh the benefits of IS. For businesses to adopt IS, it must have the following characteristics, it must show clear advantages over manual processes, be compatible with specific businesses, and it must be user-friendly. Business-size and tech-savvy employees are part of the organizational characteristics that could impact the adoption of IS. Businesses with a greater number of employees have more resources, while tech-savvy employees lower the learning barrier of the use of IS.

\subsection{\textbf{Web-based Information Systems and Traditional Information Systems}}

The study by Baskerville and Pries-Heje (2001) provides valuable insights into the challenges and strategies associated with Web-based Information Systems (IS) development as opposed to traditional IS development. Their research identified ten key concepts relevant to IS development using grounded theories, that are particularly relevant to IS development for the Internet. Causal chains, primarily driven by "time pressure" and "vague requirements" link the concepts. Baskerville and Pries-Heje (2001) explore how these concepts, such as "prototyping," "release orientation," "parallel development," and "coding your way out," were effectively applied in the Global Drinks Service (GDS) project, which operated on "Internet time" and faced the challenge of dealing with undefined project requirements. Notably, the study highlights the role of methodology in the context of IS development, emphasizing that methodology is not a static, predefined structure but rather an evolving and contingent process. It suggests that methodology is a product of the interactions between human actors, IS methods, and the problem situation, with multiple interpretations and meanings. This perspective highlights the importance of incorporating theories of sociotechnical elements in understanding IS methodologies. The study further indicates that as Internet projects expand in scope, they converge with traditional IS projects, blurring the distinctions between them. Thus, methodology in IS development is viewed as dynamic and evolving, shaped by the practices of those involved. This approach challenges the traditional notion of methodology as a fixed structure and highlights the need for a socio-technical perspective. The Multiview framework applied in this research provides valuable insight for understanding the Web IS Development Methodology (WISDM) within the context of e-commerce projects like the GDS. It acknowledges the evolving nature of methodology as a dynamic practice, emphasizing the roles of human agency and technology in IS development methodologies.
